            <p>As a life-long gamer, I was always intrigued as to how games work behind the scenes. In May 2025, I decided 
            to explore game development using the Godot Engine. Over the next months, I familiarised myself with GDScript and the engine's features, culminating in the creation of a simple 3D game-prototype. This project not only deepened my understanding of game mechanics but also enhanced my programming skills, particularly in areas like physics simulation and user input handling. The experience has been both challenging and rewarding, fueling my passion for game development and inspiring me to continue exploring this exciting field.</p>
            </p>

            <p>
            Initially, I didn't know where to start as I had very little experience with programming let alone game development.
            However, with the use of many online resources such as the official Godot documentation, YouTube tutorials and the official
            Godot community forums, I was able to piece together a simple 3D game prototype.
            </p>

            <p>
            I was able to combine multiple tutorials in order to make a very simple UI, and to code the basic mechanics of the game such as player movement, camera control,
            and simple combat with enemies. The most difficult challenge was creating the ability to switch between First Person Camera and Third Person Camera.
            After many trial and error attempts, I was able to succesffuly implement this feature by attaching two separate cameras to the player, which 
            I could then toggle between using input actions. However, this came with its own challenges as attacking in First Person View would means
            that I could see my character's hair clipping through the camera. A fix for this would be hiding my character's head when in First Person View,
            but I have not yet implemented this feature.
